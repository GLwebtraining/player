- or here: http://glwebtraining.github.io/player/index-alt.html (has different design);

To copy it to your machine:

 - download it as zip: https://github.com/GLwebtraining/player/archive/master.zip    
 - or clone it as Git Repository. It's preferred but more complex, see the Git help: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
